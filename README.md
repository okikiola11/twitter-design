# TWITTER REDESIGN

1. The user logs in to the app, only by typing the username (a proper authenticated login is **not** a requirement).
2. The user is presented with the homepage (see the *Homepage* screenshot above) that includes:
    1. Left-side menu (includes only links to pages that are implemented).
    2. *Tweets* tab in the centre (skip *Photos* and *Videos* for this MVP).
    3. Right-side section with *Who to follow (*skip *Trending for* this MVP).
3. The *Tweets* section includes:
    1. Simple form for creating a tweet.
    2. List of all tweets (sorted by most recent) that display tweet text and author details.
4. The *Who to follow* section includes:
    1. List of profiles that are not followed by the logged-in user (ordered by most recently added).
5. When the user opens the profile page (see the *Userpage* screenshot above), they can see:
    1. Left-side menu (includes only links to pages that are implemented).
    2. Cover picture and *Tweets* tab in the centre (skip other tabs and *Tweet to user* form).
    3. Right-side section with *Profile detailed info.*
6. The *Profile detailed info* section includes:
    1. User photo.
    2. Button to follow a user.
    3. Stats: total number of tweets, number of followers and number of following users.
    4. List of people who follow this user.
7. At the end extend your MVP app with one simple feature of your choice.
